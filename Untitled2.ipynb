    "bstraction in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a mechanism that allows a developer to focus on the essential characteristics of an object, while ignoring its internal implementation details.

However, the internal details of the car, such as how the engine works or how the gears are changed, are abstracted away from the user and are not important from the user's perspective.\n",
